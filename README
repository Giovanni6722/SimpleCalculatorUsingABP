A simple calculator using Automata-Based Programming (ABP),
no conditionals or control flow are ever present in
this project!

ABP is a programming practice in which a program is thought of as a
Finite-State Machine(FSM) or another automiton.

This simple calculator is a specific case in ABP, known as a
"Finite-State Machine Program", this project more closley features
The State Pattern, which is a crutial aspect of ABP

The State Pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that
allows objects to alter their own behavior upon an internal change.

Disclaimer: I am a Teaching Assistant at UB,
This project was done as a final assignment for my CSE116 class,
this is being uploaded to my github because I have added extra
functionability, and am using this for an educational presentation.
If any UB student were to come across this project and use it without consent,
you will be caught by UB's anti cheat, (As a TA, I have used it before, it
is a very good anti cheat) and you will receive an automatic F in CSE116.

You have been warned.
